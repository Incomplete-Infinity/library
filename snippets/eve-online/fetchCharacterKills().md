```js

## Summary

### Code
/**
 * This function fetches kill data for a specific character ID from the zKillboard API.
 * @param [characterID=2113672280] - The characterID parameter is the unique identifier for a character
 * in a game or application. In this case, it is used to fetch the kill history of a character from the
 * zKillboard API.
 * @returns The function `fetchCharacterKills_` is returning the result of a URL fetch request to the
 * zKillboard API for the kills of a specific character ID. The result could be a JSON object
 * containing information about the character's kills. However, the implementation of the
 * `cacheUrlFetchApp` function is not provided, so it is unclear if the result is being cached or not.
